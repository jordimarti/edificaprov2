      course_description: "The purpose of the course is to understand the basis of the Passivhaus standard. For this the course is divided into three very different chapters. The first chapter explains the philosophy of the standard, why the Passivhaus exists and how a building should be to obtain certification. In the second chapter we see a real case, a house that has obtained Passivhaus certification. From this house Micheel explains the solutions adopted to meet the standard. In the third chapter we are shown how to use PHPP, the tool to be used to make a Passivhaus certification."
